            <i>Head developer and project lead</i>
            <p>I am a volunteer and occasional staff member at TTCriders since 2020. I was born and proudly raised in Scarborough, an area neglected by transit. In TTCriders, I helped contribute to its <a href="https://www.ttcriders.ca/line3report">Line 3 Scarborough campaign</a>, designed and helped organize our <a href="https://www.ttcriders.ca/7may2022">Scarborough transit rally</a>  and <a href="https://www.ttcriders.ca/youth_leadership_conference">Youth Leadership Conferences</a>, as well as helped canvass and spread the word of our mission to create a better transit system in the City of Toronto. </p>
            <p>This project, created for (but not exculsively to) the <a href="https://www.ttcriders.ca/budget2023"> 2023 city budget campaign</a>, allows riders to know how these cuts may impact them. Users can input their specific route and see how longer they have to wait due to these changes. This uses data from Steve Munro and the Toronto Transit Commission. </p>
            <p>The framework of this project is largely based on a <a href="https://decaycalculator.twotoque.com/">Physics Radioactive Decay Calculator</a> that I made back for <a href="https://gryphhacks-2022.devpost.com/">GryphHacks 2022 (University of Guelph's Hackathon)</a>.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, or would like to chat about transit or anything (e.g. FIFA23, NHL stats, kpop, art, literally anything!) feel free to visit my website, Instagram, or LinkedIn.</p>
